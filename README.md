# GameTrackerHLTBAndroid
Custom android client for HowLongToBeat made with React Native using the [HowLongToBeat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/howlongtobeat) npm package made by [ckatzorke](https://www.npmjs.com/~ckatzorke)

[HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) is a great community-run service - please use their website instead of my horrible attempt at using an API. There's a lot of useful things - having a custom game list, tracking times, seeing how long the games can be beaten, forums, etc!
